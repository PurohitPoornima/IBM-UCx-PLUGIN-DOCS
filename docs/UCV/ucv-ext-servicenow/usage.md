# ServiceNow - Usage

To use the ServiceNow plugin, the plugin must be loaded and an instance created before you can configure the plugin integration and use plugin automation tasks. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.

See the **Automation Tasks** tab for information on using automation tasks.

## Integration type

The ServiceNow plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| syncIncidentData | Queries the ServiceNow repository for Incidents |
| syncChangeData | Queries the ServiceNow repository for Change request |
| syncProblemData | Queries the ServiceNow repository for Problems |
| ServiceNowWaitChangeTask | Checking all release Event task waiting field status |
| ServiceNowWaitRequests | Checking all release Event task waiting field status |

## Integration

There are two methods to integrate the plugin:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

### Using the user interface

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

To install the plug-in, perform the following steps:

1. In **Velocity**, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Available**
2. In the **Action** column for the ServiceNow plug-in, click **Install**.

To integrate the plug-in, perform the following steps:

1. In **Velocity**, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Installed**.
2. In the **Action** column for the ServiceNow plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Add**.

### Using a JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream and integrating with the ServiceNow server. The following table describes the information for the creating a DevOps Velocity value stream map.

1. From a value stream page, download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include the plugin configuration properties.
3. Save and upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
4. View the new integration on the Integrations page.

## OAuth

* OAuth 2.0 Authentication: 

Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure communication with third-party services.

* OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow added for ServiceNow API integration. 
* Refresh token mechanism introduced for automatic token renewal when the access token expires.

### How to integrate using OAuth
To integrate OAuth 2.0, follow these steps:

Provide the required credentials:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Username
* Password

### How to Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret in ServiceNow
Navigate to OAuth Settings:

* In your ServiceNow instance, click on All in the navigation pane.
* Go to System OAuth and select Application Registry.
* Retrieve Client ID and Generate Client Secret:

Select the application you registered.
* The Client ID will be displayed on this page.
* The Client Secret will be generated when you submit the registration.

Use for Integration:
* After creating the application, click on it to view the Client Secret. Use both the Client ID and Client Secret when integrating ServiceNow with OAuth 2.0.

Confirmation:
* Once integrated successfully, you will see a log message confirming that OAuth 2.0 is being used:
"Authentication via OAuth2.0: Using client credentials to obtain access token."

## Automation Tasks

The following automation tasks are available in the ServiceNow plugin:

* ServiceNow – Create Change Request and Change Task
* ServiceNow – Update Change Request and Change Task
* ServiceNow – Wait Change Request
* ServiceNow – Wait Change Task
